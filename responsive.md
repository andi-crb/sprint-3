Advantages of a single responsive website
- Less need for duplication
- Don't need the level of user investment required for downloading an app
- Isn't tied to a particular device, making maintenance easier and improving future-proofing

Advantages of multiple targeted apps
- Can download only the code needed for that version, rather than the full desktop version (less pressure on bandwidth).
- Makes user notifications on a mobile device easier

My preference depends heavily on the context (there are some items I believe should definitely be an app) but in general I tend to prefer responsive websites.
